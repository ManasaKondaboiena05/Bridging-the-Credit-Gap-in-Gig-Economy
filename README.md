ABSTRACT:

India’s expanding gig economy, propelled by smartphones and digital platforms, offers pivotal income opportunities but remains burdened by financial exclusion. Gig workers face significant barriers to formal credit due to irregular earnings, lack of documentation, and unverifiable credit histories. This policy brief identifies two core challenges: the incomplete identification of gig workers within national databases and restricted credit access following the RBI’s regulation tightening on unsecured lending.
To address these gaps, we propose a two-pronged approach: (1) Revamp the E-Shram portal by mandating enrollment and integrating a credit-tracking feature that facilitates seamless access to credit; and (2) Cushion the NBFC and fintech landscape to increase credit access to gig workers. This will be done by providing a First Loss Coverage Guarantee to NBFCs, which gives better coverage to NBFCs than under existing schemes, comprehensive loan categories and loan upgrade mechanisms, while reforming bureaucratic processes. We aim for these reforms to formalise gig worker data, unlock credit access, and strengthen financial resilience in India’s evolving labour market.
